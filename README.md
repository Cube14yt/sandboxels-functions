A way to see function parameters and whats available in a element defenition for the sandboxels modding environment

If you want to use it put the .d.ts file in your mod folder and add this to the top of your mod:

```js
/// <reference path="./sandboxels-functions.d.ts" />
```

Now you should see that functions have their parameters and their value. It should also show you the things available in the element definition
